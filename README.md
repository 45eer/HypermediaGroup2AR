Hpermedia Group 2 AR App
This was a quick and dirty android app making use of Amazon sumerian for Augmented Reality to showcase information about the Port of Oswego and the Maritime Museum here in Oswego NY for a hypermedia class in the HCI program.
It was written in Java and made a lot of use of available resources from Amazon and their tutorials.
